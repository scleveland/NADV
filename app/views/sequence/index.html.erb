This application is designed to translate a nucleotide sequence in the first reading frame when the start codon is encountered.  The results will be the Amino Acid sequence or sequences derived from the nucleotide sequence - the results are displayed with the Amino Acids aligned over the nucleotides and can be downloaded as a textfile.

Paste Nucleotide sequence in to the text area for translation and display.
